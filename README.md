###### Mediator Pattern

This pattern provides a mediator class which normally handles all the communications between different classes and supports easy maintenance of the code by loose coupling. Mediator pattern falls under behavioral pattern category.


###### Memento Pattern

This pattern has 3 actors

   1. Memento
   2. Originator
   3. CareTaker
   
   Memento contains state of the object to be restored
   
   Originator creates and stores states in Memento objects
   
   Caretaker is responsible to restore object state from memento
